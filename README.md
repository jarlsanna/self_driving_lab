# self_driving_lab
This project is about structuring our code for remotely controlling the sputtering machine in the lab, as well as process data from the experiments. 
Currently all the code is just a collection of functions, and the aim of this project is to organize the code in a better way such as into classes, 
add documentation, unit tests, and also trying to optimize it to be faster. 

Also see some homework exercises in the folders.
